Feature: Action DSL

  The role DSL helps us write actions in a succint and readable way, reminiscent of Capybara's and Webrat's own DSLs. The big difference is that the role DSL works exclusively with widgets.

  Scenario: Visiting a page

    Given the following HTML at the path "/somewhere":
      """
      <div id="here"></div>
      """
    And the following widget definition:
      """
      Here = Dill::Widget('#here')
      """
    And the following role definition:
      """
      class Visitor < Dill::Role
        def go
          visit "/somewhere"
        end
      end
      """
    When we ask the role to execute the action:
      """
      role = Visitor.new

      role.go
      """
    Then we should see the role did so:
      """
      visible?(:here) #=> true
      """

  @javascript
  Scenario: Clicking a widget

    `click :widget_name` is a shortcut for `widget(:widget_name).click`.

      """
    And the following widget definition:
      """
      Clickme = Dill::Widget('#clickme')
      """
    And the following role definition:
      """
      class Clicker < Dill::Role
        def go
          visit "/somewhere"

          click :clickme
        end
      end
      """
    When we ask the role to execute the action:
      """
      role = Clicker.new

      role.go
