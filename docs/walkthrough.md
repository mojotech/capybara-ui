#A Capybara-UI Walkthrough
Capybara-UI might best be thought of as three layers.

    ROLES, that perform => TASKS, which manipulate => ELEMENTS

For this walkthrough, we're going to write an Rspec test using Capybara-UI. If we use these concepts of Roles, Tasks and Elements, our test might end up looking something like this:

```ruby
describe 'Admin' do
  it 'should be able to create a new user' do
    params = { name: 'Example', email: 'example@example.com' }

    roles.admin.navigate_to_new_user
    roles.admin.create_user(params)

    expect(roles.admin).to see :new_user_message
  end
end
```

You can start to see in the expect statement that Capybara-UI is magical, too.


##Roles
A Capybara-UI role groups tasks and elements together, and is defined as a class.
See the [setting up roles](https://github.com/mojotech/capybara-ui/wiki/Setting-Up-Roles) section in the wiki for more how-to ideas.

```ruby
class Admin < Capybara::UI::Role
  ...
end
```


##Tasks
A task is just a method on a role.

```ruby
class Admin < Capybara::UI::Role
  def navigate_to_new_user
    ...
  end

  def create_user(params)
    ...
  end

  ...
end
```


##Elements
Elements are where the Capybara-UI amazingness begins, as well as where the Capybara-UI confusion heats up. Elements are dom abstractions that allow for precise testing. By using dom element attributes we can easily create the most basic Capybara-UI Element, a widget.

```ruby
class Admin < Capybara::UI::Role
  widget :new_user_button, 'a.add-user'
end
```

This widget uses css selectors to search the page for a link with the `add-user` class. That dom element is then wrapped into a Capybara-UI object, complete with a useful interface.

```ruby
  widget(:new_user_button).text # => 'Add a new user'
```

Building on our example, we can now click the link.

```ruby
class Admin < Capybara::UI::Role
  def navigate_to_new_user
    click :new_user_button
  end

  def create_user(params)
    ...
  end

  ...
end
```

Capybara-UI has a small arsenal of elements that work nicely with some of the more difficult-to-test DOM elements. Here is a **form** element, where we map the form widget to field sub-widgets, again using DOM attributes (here we're using names).

```ruby
class Admin < Capybara::UI::Role
  def navigate_to_new_user
    click :new_user_button
  end

  form :new_user_form, 'form.new-user' do
    text_field :name, 'user'
    text_field :email, 'email'
  end

  def create_user(changes)
    submit :new_user_form, changes
  end

  ...
end
```

Finally, let's explore that Capybara-UI magic in the expect clause of our example spec. Capybara-UI's `see` expectation method, by default, will simply check for the presence of a widget by that name.

```ruby
class Admin < Capybara::UI::Role
  def navigate_to_new_user
    click :new_user_button
  end

  form :new_user_form, 'form.new-user' do
    text_field :name, 'user'
    text_field :email, 'email'
  end

  def create_user(changes)
    submit :new_user_form, changes
  end

  widget :new_user_message, '.flash.new-user-success'
end
```

That's it for the walkthrough, but Capybara-UI has a lot more to offer. We recommend digging into Widgets next, as Widget is the fundamental class common to all the Capybara-UI elements.
